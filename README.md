[![Add Print Bridge to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=print_bridge)

Print common email attachments directly to a network printer — fully inside Home Assistant.

Print Bridge turns an email inbox or local folder into a controlled print
intake. It listens to Home Assistant's built-in IMAP events or scans a configured
queue folder, fetches printable documents, converts supported types to an
internal PDF, merges all matching attachments in one email into one job, applies
duplex/booklet rules, and submits the result to CUPS or directly to an
IPP/AirPrint printer.

It was built because Home Assistant has the pieces but not the end-to-end
printing workflow:

- The built-in **IMAP** integration can announce new mail, but it does not
  convert attachments, manage print policy, or submit jobs to a printer.
- The built-in **IPP** integration monitors printers; it does not send
  `Print-Job` requests.
- Generic automations become fragile for real mail printing: attachment payloads
  can be large, filenames can be MIME-encoded, printers may reject PDF and need
  raster conversion, booklet jobs need page imposition, and busy printers need
  retry logic.

Print Bridge is the missing glue: one local integration that owns the print
pipeline, exposes HA entities and services, keeps audit history, and lets normal
Home Assistant automations stay simple.

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| **Home Assistant OS** | ✅ | Recommended — full mDNS discovery, all features |
| **Home Assistant Supervised** | ✅ | Full support on any Linux host |
| **Home Assistant Container** (`--network=host`) | ✅ | Host networking required for mDNS |
| **Home Assistant Core** (Linux) | ✅ | mDNS works if the host has Avahi/Bonjour |
| **Docker (bridge network)** | ⚠️ | mDNS discovery limited — type IPP URL manually |

> mDNS printer discovery runs on the HA host and requires multicast packets to reach the HA process.
> Docker bridge networking blocks multicast, so auto-discovery will not find LAN printers.
> You can still configure a printer manually by typing its IPP URL.

---

## Use Cases

| Use case | Why Print Bridge helps |
|---|---|
| **Email-to-printer mailbox** | Forward documents to a dedicated mailbox such as `print@example.com`; matching attachments print automatically. |
| **Folder-to-printer drop box** | Put files in the configured queue folder and Print Bridge prints them even when no IMAP integration exists. |
| **Family or office shared printing** | Allow trusted senders only, while keeping printer access inside Home Assistant. |
| **Weekly newsletters and parasha sheets** | Match sender, subject, folder, or filename; print regular PDFs automatically without opening a laptop. |
| **Booklets and folded handouts** | Detect filename patterns or mail parameters, reorder pages for saddle-stitch booklet printing, force short-edge duplex, and request landscape fitting. |
| **Invoices, bank letters, receipts** | Print selected senders one-sided or duplex, then mark mail as read, move it to an archive folder, or leave it untouched. |
| **Multiple attachments in one email** | Convert and merge matching attachments into one job so the printer receives fewer submissions and prints faster. |
| **Direct AirPrint printer without CUPS** | Send IPP directly to modern printers; when PDF is not supported, convert internally to PWG Raster or JPEG. |
| **Legacy or USB printer via CUPS** | Let CUPS handle drivers while Print Bridge handles mail rules, queueing, conversion, audit, and Home Assistant controls. |
| **Quiet-hours printing** | Hold jobs outside allowed days/hours or a custom HA template gate, then flush them when the window opens. |
| **Unreliable/busy printers** | Queue jobs when the printer reports `server-error-busy`, poll readiness, and resend when it is available. |
| **Status feedback to sender** | Reply with success/failure, IPP status code, and the effective settings used for the job. |

---

## Why a Dedicated Integration?

This is intentionally not just an automation blueprint. A blueprint can route an
event, but it cannot safely own the whole print lifecycle. Print Bridge needs to
decode MIME filenames, fetch large attachments on demand, convert common file
types, merge PDFs, impose booklets, query printer capabilities, translate to a
printer-supported document format, poll and retry busy printers, record audit
events, expose queue state, and optionally reply to the original sender.

Keeping that logic in a custom integration gives Home Assistant a clear boundary:
IMAP still owns mail credentials, CUPS or the printer still owns physical
printing, and Print Bridge owns the policy and transformation layer between
them.

## Prerequisites

### HA integrations — what is and isn't needed

| Integration | Required? | Role |
|---|:---:|---|
| **HA IMAP** (built-in) | Optional | Required only for email automation. Without IMAP, Print Bridge can still print files from the queue folder or via `print_file`. |
| **HA IPP** (built-in) | **No** | Monitors printer status (ink, paper, errors). Print Bridge does **not** use it — Print Bridge *is* its own IPP client and sends `Print-Job` packets directly. |
| **CUPS add-on** | Optional | Needed for USB printers or non-AirPrint printers that require driver conversion. AirPrint printers can be reached directly via IPP. |

> **Why not the HA IPP integration?**
> HA's built-in `ipp` integration ([docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ipp/)) is a *monitoring* tool — it reads printer state, ink levels, and page counts.
> Print Bridge speaks raw IPP/2.0 directly to the printer or CUPS server and submits `Print-Job` requests.
> You can install both side-by-side: use the HA IPP integration to monitor ink/status,
> and Print Bridge to receive and dispatch print jobs.

Print Bridge also uses `Get-Printer-Attributes` itself when needed to discover
supported document formats and to decide when a busy direct IPP printer is ready
for the next queued job.

---

### 1. HA IMAP Integration (built-in) — optional for email printing

> Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → **IMAP**

Configure it with your mail server details.
Print Bridge listens to the `imap_content` events it fires — **no credentials are stored in Print Bridge**. Skip this step if you only want to print files dropped into the queue folder.

### 2. Printer — required; choose one

#### Option A — Direct IPP (no extra software needed)

Any WiFi printer with AirPrint support (manufactured after ~2012) has a built-in IPP server.
Print Bridge can send jobs directly to the printer's endpoint, for example:

```
http://printer.local/ipp/print        (standard AirPrint path)
http://printer.local:631/ipp/print    (CUPS-style port)
```

No add-ons, no CUPS required. Set this URL in the **Direct IPP Printer URL** field during setup.

#### Option B — Via CUPS (for USB or legacy printers)

The recommended option for HA OS is the **[CUPS add-on by peternicholls](https://github.com/peternicholls/ha-cups-addon)**:

1. **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store** → add repository `https://github.com/peternicholls/ha-cups-addon`
2. Install **CUPS Print Server** and start it.
3. Open the CUPS web UI at `http://<ha-host>:631` → add your printer.
4. Note the **queue name** shown in the CUPS Printers list.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Click the button below to open Print Bridge directly in HACS:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository?owner=rubeecube&repository=ha-print-bridge&category=integration)

Or add it manually: **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/rubeecube/ha-print-bridge` (category **Integration**) → search **Print Bridge** → install → restart HA.

### After installation — open the config flow

Once installed (via HACS or manually), click here to add the integration to your HA instance:

[![Add Print Bridge to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=print_bridge)

### Manual (without HACS)

Copy `custom_components/print_bridge/` into your HA config directory and restart:

```
/config/custom_components/print_bridge/
```

---

## Configuration

### Step 1 — Optional HA IMAP Integration

Configure the built-in IMAP integration first only if you want email-triggered printing (see [Prerequisites](#1-ha-imap-integration-built-in--optional-for-email-printing)).

### Step 2 — Add Print Bridge

> Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → **Print Bridge**

The setup wizard auto-discovers both **CUPS** and **direct IPP printers** at common addresses and lists any IMAP accounts already configured in HA.

#### Option A — Direct IPP (no CUPS required)

For any AirPrint / IPP-capable printer on your network (including most Canon PIXMA with AirPrint), you can print directly without CUPS:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Direct IPP Printer URL | `http://printer.local/ipp/print` or `ipp://printer.local/ipp/print` |

The integration sends an IPP `Print-Job` packet directly to the printer. Modern
AirPrint printers usually accept PDF natively; if a direct IPP printer advertises
only PWG Raster or JPEG, Print Bridge converts the internal PDF to the accepted
format before submission. Leave the CUPS fields empty.

#### Option B — Via CUPS

| Field | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CUPS Base URL | `http://cups.local:631` | Auto-filled if CUPS is found; edit if on a different host |
| Printer Name | `Canon_MG3600_series` | Select from discovered printers, or choose **Enter name manually…** |

Use CUPS when: the printer is USB-attached, needs driver/raster conversion, or you want a managed print queue.

#### Common to both modes

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Pre-fill Senders from | Optional — pre-loads an IMAP account's address into Allowed Senders |

### Options (editable any time)

> Settings → Devices & Services → Print Bridge → **Configure**

The form shows a live hint: *"Your IMAP integrations monitor: INBOX (print@example.com)"* so you know which exact folder names to use.

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Allowed Senders** | *(empty = all)* | One email address per line. Empty accepts mail from any sender. |
| **IMAP Folder Filter** | *(empty = all)* | One folder name per line. Empty accepts mail from any folder. Use the exact name shown in the hint above (e.g. `INBOX`, `INBOX/Print`). |
| **Default Duplex Mode** | Two-sided portrait | Fallback for all jobs. |
| **Booklet Patterns** | *(empty)* | Filename substrings that trigger booklet page reordering. |
| **Delete after printing** | On | Remove successfully printed queue-folder files. If off, printed files are remembered and not reprinted unless modified. |
| **Print Queue Folder** | `/media/print_queue` | Drop supported files here for folder-to-printer intake. Also used by the queue-depth sensor and `clear_queue`. |
| **Raster DPI** | `150` | Used only when direct IPP printing must convert PDFs to PWG Raster/JPEG. Lower values are faster and create smaller jobs. |
| **Email Action after Printing** | Do nothing | What to do with the email after the PDF prints: **Do nothing** / **Mark as read** / **Move to archive folder** / **Delete from server**. |
| **Archive Folder** | `INBOX/Printed` | Target folder when "Move to archive folder" is selected. Created automatically by most IMAP servers. |
| **Notify when print fails** | On | Send a HA persistent notification when a job fails (with error details). |
| **Notify when print succeeds** | Off | Send a HA persistent notification when a job completes successfully. |
| **Reply to sender with print status** | Off | Send a status email to the original sender after printing. Requires an email-capable HA notify service. |
| **Status Reply Notify Service** | *(empty)* | Notify service used for status replies, for example `notify.smtp`. |
| **Enable print schedule** | Off | Hold matching jobs in the scheduled queue until the configured day, hour, and template gates are open. |
| **Print window start/end** | `07:00` / `22:00` | Allowed local print hours in 24-hour `HH:MM` format. Windows can wrap midnight. |
| **Print days** | *(every day)* | Optional weekday list. Use `mon`, `tue`, full names, or `1`-`7`; one per line or comma-separated. |
| **Print schedule template** | *(empty)* | Optional HA template. Jobs print only when it renders truthy (`true`, `on`, `yes`, or `1`). Available variables include `now`, `schedule_time`, `schedule_weekday`, `schedule_window_day`, `schedule_days`, `schedule_start`, `schedule_end`, and `printer_name`. |

## After Setup — Where to find everything

After configuring the integration you will see a notification:
**"Print Bridge — Action required"** — follow the links in it, then dismiss it.

### 1. Find your entities

> Settings → Devices & Services → Integrations → **Print Bridge** → click the device card

All sensors, buttons, and binary sensors appear here. You can press **Check Filter** directly from this page to scan your mailbox.

### 2. Add the management dashboard

For the easiest setup, copy `lovelace/printer_dashboard_template.yaml` from the repo into a new dashboard view:

> Your Dashboard → Edit → Add View → Manual configuration (YAML) → paste the file contents

Replace `YOUR_SLUG` with the entity slug shown in Developer Tools → States when you search "print\_bridge" (e.g. `canonmg3600series`).

The simple template includes component configuration controls, mailbox/printer selectors, status tiles, and print actions. The detailed audit view remains available at `lovelace/print_bridge_audit.yaml`.

### 3. Choose your printing mode

Use the dashboard **Auto Print** switch:

- **On** — simple setup; Print Bridge prints supported attachments from allowed senders and supported files from the queue folder automatically.
- **Off** — use the automation blueprint for per-sender / per-keyword rules.

### 4. Enable debug logging (troubleshooting)

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.print_bridge: debug
```

Then go to **Settings → System → Logs** to view debug output. This shows each discovery step, event received, and print job stage.

## Services

### Supported files

Print Bridge converts supported non-PDF inputs to an internal PDF before the
existing booklet, CUPS/direct IPP, raster, status reply, queue, and audit
pipeline runs. Conversion is best effort: readable content, basic tables, sheet
names, slide text, and image pages are preserved, but Office-perfect pagination,
macros, charts, embedded objects, headers/footers, and complex layout are not
guaranteed.

Supported: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.docm`, `.odt`, `.rtf`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.htm`,
`.md`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xls`, `.ods`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.pptx`, `.odp`,
`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.tif`, `.tiff`, `.bmp`, `.webp`.

Explicitly unsupported: legacy binary `.doc` and `.ppt` files. These need an
external office engine such as LibreOffice, which Print Bridge does not bundle.

### Queue folder intake

When **Auto Print** is enabled, Print Bridge also scans the configured **Print
Queue Folder**. Any stable supported file found there is printed through the
same conversion, booklet, direct IPP/CUPS, busy-printer retry, audit, and
notification pipeline as email attachments.

Temporary or hidden files are ignored. Successfully printed files are deleted
when **Delete after printing** is enabled. If deletion is disabled, each file is
printed once per modification time and will not repeat until it changes.

### `print_bridge.print_file`

Print a supported file from the HA filesystem. Non-PDF files are converted to an
internal PDF first.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `file_path` | yes | Absolute path to the supported file |
| `duplex` | no | Override duplex for this job |
| `booklet` | no | Force booklet page reordering |
| `copies` | no | Number of copies, 1-20 |
| `orientation` | no | `portrait` or `landscape`; booklet jobs force `landscape` |
| `media` | no | IPP media keyword, such as `iso_a4_210x297mm` |
| `raster_dpi` | no | Direct IPP raster conversion DPI, 72-600. Lower is faster; default is `150`. |

### `print_bridge.clear_queue`

Delete all supported printable files from the configured queue folder.

### `print_bridge.process_imap_part`

Fetch a specific IMAP attachment and print it.
Used internally by the blueprint; callable from any automation or script.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `entry_id` | yes | IMAP config entry ID (`trigger.event.data.entry_id`) |
| `uid` | yes | Email UID (`trigger.event.data.uid`) |
| `part_key` | yes | Part key from `trigger.event.data.parts` |
| `filename` | no | Display name for the print job |
| `duplex` | no | Override duplex for this job |
| `booklet` | no | Force booklet page reordering |
| `attachment_filter` | no | Only print if the filename contains this text |
| `copies` | no | Number of copies, 1-20 |
| `orientation` | no | `portrait` or `landscape`; booklet jobs force `landscape` |
| `media` | no | IPP media keyword, such as `iso_a4_210x297mm` |
| `raster_dpi` | no | Direct IPP raster conversion DPI, 72-600. Lower is faster; default is `150`. |
| `sender` | no | Original email sender, used for status replies |
| `mail_subject` | no | Original email subject, used for mail parameters and reply title |
| `mail_text` | no | Original plain-text email body, used for mail parameters |

### `print_bridge.process_imap_message`

Fetch all supported attachments from an IMAP message, convert them to PDF, merge
them in email attachment order, and submit one print job. This is the default
path used by the bundled blueprint because it is faster when one email has
multiple attachments.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `entry_id` | yes | IMAP config entry ID (`trigger.event.data.entry_id`) |
| `uid` | yes | Email UID (`trigger.event.data.uid`) |
| `parts` | no | Parts dictionary from `trigger.event.data.parts`; avoids one metadata fetch |
| `duplex` | no | Override duplex for this job |
| `booklet` | no | Force booklet page reordering |
| `attachment_filter` | no | Only include attachment filenames containing this text |
| `copies` | no | Number of copies, 1-20 |
| `orientation` | no | `portrait` or `landscape`; booklet imposition is landscape |
| `media` | no | IPP media keyword, such as `iso_a4_210x297mm` |
| `raster_dpi` | no | Direct IPP raster conversion DPI, 72-600. Lower is faster; default is `150`. |
| `sender` | no | Original email sender, used for status replies |
| `mail_subject` | no | Original email subject, used for mail parameters and reply title |
| `mail_text` | no | Original plain-text email body, used for mail parameters |

### `print_bridge.print_email`

Print all supported attachments from a specific email in your mailbox as one
combined job — on demand, without waiting for the email to arrive again. Get the
UID from the Lovelace email table or the `filter_preview` sensor.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `uid` | yes | IMAP UID of the email (shown in the Lovelace email table) |
| `imap_entry_id` | no | IMAP config entry ID — defaults to the first configured account |
| `duplex` | no | Override duplex for this job |
| `booklet` | no | Force booklet page reordering |
| `attachment_filter` | no | Only print matching attachment filenames |
| `copies` | no | Number of copies, 1-20 |
| `orientation` | no | `portrait` or `landscape`; booklet jobs force `landscape` |
| `media` | no | IPP media keyword, such as `iso_a4_210x297mm` |
| `raster_dpi` | no | Direct IPP raster conversion DPI, 72-600. Lower is faster; default is `150`. |

### Mail print parameters

You can include per-email print settings in the subject or body. These override the integration defaults and blueprint/service values for that email.

Subject form:

```text
[pb booklet=true duplex=short-edge copies=2 paper=a4 dpi=150 reply=true]
```

Body form:

```text
Print-Bridge: attachment="Au Puits"; orientation=landscape; paper=a4; quality=fast
```

Supported parameters:

| Parameter | Values |
|---|---|
| `duplex` / `sides` | `one-sided`, `simplex`, `long-edge`, `short-edge`, `two-sided-long-edge`, `two-sided-short-edge` |
| `booklet` | `true` / `false` |
| `copies` | `1` through `20` |
| `orientation` | `portrait` / `landscape`; booklet jobs always request landscape |
| `paper` / `media` | `a4`, `letter`, `legal`, or a raw IPP media keyword |
| `dpi` / `raster_dpi` | `72` through `600`; only used when direct IPP requires raster conversion |
| `quality` | `draft`, `fast`, `normal`, `high`, or `best` (`fast` maps to 150 DPI) |
| `attachment` / `attachment_filter` / `file` | Filename substring to print only matching attachments |
| `reply` / `status_reply` | `true` to request a status reply, `false` to suppress one |

Status replies include the IPP status code plus the effective printer settings used for each job. Print Bridge uses the configured Home Assistant notify service when set (for example `notify.smtp`); otherwise it attempts SMTP delivery through the matching HA IMAP account.

**From Developer Tools → Services:**
```yaml
service: print_bridge.print_email
data:
  uid: "42"
  duplex: two-sided-long-edge
```

**From an automation, after `check_filter`:**
```yaml
action: print_bridge.print_email
data:
  uid: "{{ state_attr('sensor.print_bridge_PRINTER_NAME_filter_preview', 'emails')[0].uid }}"
```

### `print_bridge.check_filter`

Connect to IMAP and list emails that match the current filter settings.
Returns a service response and updates `sensor.print_bridge_*_filter_preview`.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `imap_entry_id` | no | Which IMAP entry to query (defaults to first configured) |

---

## Audit Log

Every print attempt fires an `print_bridge_job_completed` event to the HA event bus.
This event appears in the native HA **Logbook** as a human-readable sentence:

> **Print Bridge** — Printed `invoice.pdf`  ·  two-sided-long-edge  ·  from billing@example.com  ·  Canon_MG3600_series

> **Print Bridge** — Print failed for `bad.pdf`: HTTP 503  ·  from sender@example.com

The `sensor.print_bridge_*_job_log` entity stores the last 50 jobs as attributes,
including timestamp, filename, success/failure, sender, duplex mode, and booklet flag.
It also stores the effective IPP sides, document format, status code, copies,
orientation, media, and raster DPI when available.

## Blueprint — Advanced Per-Email Rules

For fine-grained per-sender or per-keyword rules (different duplex per sender,
booklet for some subjects, multiple printers), use the included automation blueprint.

### Import

**Settings → Automations → Blueprints → Import Blueprint** — paste:

```
https://github.com/rubeecube/ha-print-bridge/blob/main/blueprints/automation/print_bridge/print_from_email.yaml
```

### Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| IMAP Account | — | Which IMAP integration entry to monitor |
| Allowed Senders | *(all)* | Comma-separated addresses |
| IMAP Folder Filter | *(all)* | Comma-separated folder names |
| Subject Must Contain | *(all)* | Optional keyword gate on the subject line |
| Default Duplex Mode | Two-sided portrait | Fallback for all jobs |
| One-sided Keywords | — | Subject keywords that override to one-sided |
| Two-sided Portrait Keywords | — | Subject keywords that force long-edge duplex |
| Booklet Keywords | — | Subject keywords that trigger booklet reordering |
| Booklet Senders | — | Senders whose mail is always printed as a booklet |
| Mark as Seen | On | Set `\Seen` flag on the email after processing |

### Decision logic

```
imap_content event received
        │
        ├─ folder in folder_filter? (empty = yes) ──── no ──► skip
        │
        ├─ sender in allowed_senders? (empty = yes) ── no ──► skip
        │
        ├─ subject contains filter? (empty = yes) ───── no ──► skip
        │
        ├─ any printable attachment? ───────────────── no ──► skip
        │
        └─ convert matching attachments to PDF
                 apply mail parameters / blueprint settings
                 merge attachments into one job
                 apply booklet imposition after merge
                 ──► print_bridge.process_imap_message(duplex, booklet)
                 ──► imap.seen  (if mark_as_seen)
```

### Example — multiple rule sets

**Automation 1 — Invoices (one-sided, INBOX):**
- Folder Filter: `INBOX`
- Allowed Senders: `billing@mybank.com`
- One-sided Keywords: `INVOICE`

**Automation 2 — Programmes (booklet, INBOX/Print):**
- Folder Filter: `INBOX/Print`
- Booklet Keywords: `Programme, Bulletin`
- Default Duplex: Two-sided landscape

## Lovelace Audit Dashboard

A paste-ready dashboard view is included at [`lovelace/printer_dashboard_template.yaml`](lovelace/printer_dashboard_template.yaml).
The fuller audit dashboard is still available at [`lovelace/print_bridge_audit.yaml`](lovelace/print_bridge_audit.yaml).

Add it as a new view to any dashboard (**Edit → Add View → Manual Configuration (YAML)**).
Replace `PRINTER_NAME` with the slug for your printer queue name.

The view includes:

- **Status row** — printer online, queue depth, jobs sent, last job status
- **Scheduled Queue table** — up to 5 scheduled or printer-busy jobs with filename, sender/settings, and queue time
- **Logbook card** — 7-day print event history
- **Recent jobs table** — last 50 jobs: timestamp / filename / ✅❌ / sender / duplex / booklet
- **Filter Preview table** — folder / subject / sender / ✅match / PDF count
- **Statistics graph** — daily job counts (30 days)
- **Action buttons** — Check Filter, Print Test Page, Clear Queue, Cancel Queued Jobs

---

## Developer Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubeecube/ha-print-bridge
cd ha-print-bridge
chmod +x setup-dev.sh && ./setup-dev.sh
```

`setup-dev.sh` activates git hooks (pre-commit + pre-push author checks), sets a
repo-local git identity, and creates the Python venv.

```bash
# Run tests
./venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v

# Validation stack (HA + GreenMail IMAP + CUPS with cups-pdf)
cd docker && docker compose up -d --build
HA_TOKEN=<token> ./validate.sh
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need IMAP?**
A: No. IMAP is only needed for email-triggered printing. Without IMAP, enable **Auto Print** and put supported files in the configured **Print Queue Folder**, or call `print_bridge.print_file`.

**Q: Can I print from multiple email addresses?**  
A: Yes — add one address per line in **Allowed Senders**, or leave it empty to accept all.

**Q: Can I filter by mailbox folder?**  
A: Yes — add one folder name per line in **IMAP Folder Filter** (e.g. `INBOX/Print`). The hint in the Options form shows the exact folder names your IMAP integration monitors. Leave empty to accept all folders.

**Q: How do I check which emails would be printed right now?**  
A: Press the **Check Filter** button (or call `print_bridge.check_filter`). Results appear in the `sensor.print_bridge_*_filter_preview` entity and in the Lovelace audit view.

**Q: What if my PDF is very large?**  
A: Print Bridge calls `imap.fetch_part` which has no size limit (unlike the 32 KB event body limit).

**Q: How do I enable booklet printing?**  
A: Add a substring of the attachment filename to **Booklet Patterns** in the options (e.g. `Programme`). Any matching attachment or merged email job is automatically reordered for saddle-stitch printing.

**Q: What happens to the email after it's printed?**  
A: Configure **Email Action after Printing** in Options: **Mark as read** keeps it in your inbox but removes the unread badge; **Move to archive folder** moves it to `INBOX/Printed` (or a folder you choose) and marks it read; **Delete from server** removes it permanently. Default is **Do nothing** (no change to the email).

**Q: How do I get notified when a print job fails?**  
A: **Notify when print fails** is enabled by default. A HA persistent notification will appear in the bell (🔔) menu with the filename and error. Enable **Notify when print succeeds** if you also want confirmation of successful prints.

**Q: Do I need to install HA's built-in IPP integration?**  
A: No. HA's `ipp` integration ([docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ipp/)) is a *printer monitor* — it reads ink levels, paper status, and error codes. Print Bridge is its own IPP client: it builds raw IPP/2.0 `Print-Job` packets and sends them directly to the printer or CUPS server via HTTP POST. The two integrations are independent and can be installed side-by-side.

| | HA IPP integration | Print Bridge |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Monitor printer state (ink, errors) | Send print jobs from email |
| **Protocol** | Reads IPP attributes | Writes IPP Print-Job |
| **Required for printing** | No | Yes |
| **Useful together** | Yes — monitors the same printer | Yes — sends jobs to same printer |

Print Bridge is separate because print submission, attachment conversion,
booklet imposition, queueing, retries, and sender status replies are outside
the scope of HA's printer-monitoring integration.

**Q: Do I need CUPS at all?**  
A: Not for modern AirPrint printers. If your printer has an IPP endpoint (most WiFi printers made after ~2015 do), use **Direct IPP mode** with a URL like `http://printer.local/ipp/print`. CUPS is useful when the printer is USB-attached, needs format conversion (PCL/PostScript), or you want a managed queue.

**Q: How do I find my printer's IPP URL?**  
A: Common paths: `http://printer.local/ipp/print`, `http://printer.local:631/ipp/print`, or the same paths with your printer host name. Your router's device list shows the printer's network name. For Canon PIXMA: the embedded server is usually at port 80 with path `/ipp/print`.

**Q: CUPS is on a different host. What URL do I use?**  
A: `http://<cups-host>:631`. When using the CUPS add-on on HA OS with host networking, the host can be your HA host name.
